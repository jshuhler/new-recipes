    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>Lasagna. Just saying the word feels like coming home, doesn’t it? When I think of lasagna, I think of that trip I never actually took to Italy in 2012, the one where I almost booked an Airbnb in Tuscany but instead bought a scented candle called “Mediterranean Breeze.” Funny how life works out.</p>
    <p>This dish reminds me of my grandmother, who wasn’t Italian, or really much of a cook. She once microwaved a turkey. But she believed in lasagna, in the way one believes in the healing power of warm socks or the quiet dignity of a well-sharpened pencil. I remember her saying, “You don’t need to be fancy to make lasagna, just patient and a little reckless.” She was talking about love, or maybe debt. Either way, it stuck with me. 
    <p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Can’t I just scroll down to the recipe?” You could, of course. You could scroll right past this, like my cousin Benny scrolled past every meaningful conversation we ever tried to have. But if you do, you’ll miss the story of how I came to discover the secret ingredient that makes this lasagna truly mine. Spoiler: it’s pre-shredded mozzarella from the grocery store because I am, above all, tired.</p> 
    <p>The first time I made this lasagna, it was a gray Tuesday, the kind that smells faintly of printer ink and unfulfilled dreams. I layered the noodles like geological strata, each one a record of my mistakes and small triumphs. The sauce bubbled up like the molten core of the earth itself, except tangier. When I pulled it from the oven, golden and chaotic, I realized something profound: lasagna doesn’t fix your life, but it does make it smell better for about forty-five minutes. So yes, you could just jump to the recipe. But then you’d miss the part where I tell you that lasagna, like love, like Wi-Fi, is best when the layers all connect.</p> 
    <p>Anyway, here’s my recipe for lasagna.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta, flat</li>
        <li>Meat, whatever grade and animal</li>
        <li>Cheese, soft</li>
        <li>Sauce, red</li>
        <li>Cheese, gratable</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta until flaccid.</li>
        <li>Layer literally all of the ingredients in whatever order you want, with as much of each of them that you feel like using.</li>
        <li>Grate the gratable cheese all over the whole pile.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven at the appropriate temperature for the correct amount of time. You know what it needs best.</li>
    </ol>
